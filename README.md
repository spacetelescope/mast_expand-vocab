# mast_hlsp-vocab
This repo contains some of the draft vocabularies being worked on by MAST staff, currently focused on vocabularies for High Level Science Products (with potential long-term interest in MCCMs, other data collections that aren't consistently available in CAOM, and query expansion/travel between different collections/unified search). 

Currently an extremely preliminary rough draft---intended as a starting place for conversations, and as something for developers to use while working on prototypes.

Current notional draft schematic:

**Product Types: ______** <br>
(Open question: whether to include/split/exclude calibration and auxiliary types.)

**Object Types: ______** <br>
(Open question: whether to distinguish between intended targets and incidentally observed objects.)

**Number of Targets:** <br>
X Any <br>
X Individual Target only <br>
X Atlas, Survey, or Field only <br>
(indent?) X All-Sky Map only

**Data derived from:** <br>
X Any <br>
X Observations only <br>
X Models only <br>

**Journal Keywords: ______** <br>
