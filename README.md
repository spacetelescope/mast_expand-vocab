# mast_expand-vocab
This repo contains some of the draft vocabularies being worked on by MAST staff, currently focused on vocabularies for High Level Science Products (with potential long-term interest in MCCMs, other data collections that aren't consistently available in CAOM, and query expansion/travel between different collections/unified search). 

Currently an extremely preliminary rough draft---intended as a starting place for conversations, and as something for developers to use while working on prototypes.
